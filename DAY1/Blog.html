    <p>Set on a pastel painted Earth, parallel to our own and, thus far, unburdened by the weight of the cumbersome perplexities of the MCU, The Fantastic Four: First Steps serves up a breezy continuation of Marvel’s recent revival in legitimate entertainment. It’s ‘no homework required’ – in the words of Kevin Feige himself – fun and so game for good times that it squeezes the titular quartet’s entire origins story into a five minute montage. Wise move. Those in the know, know already that the Four are to join the main fray in next year’s hotly anticipated Avengers: Doomsday. Those who couldn’t care less can sit back, relax, and switch off – assuming they haven’t already, in a different sense of the phrase. Never mind first step, it’s a stride back in the right direction</p>

    <a style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superman_(2025_film)"><h1 style="color: black;" >SUPERMAN</h1></a>
    <p>It’s hard not to feel for Henry Cavill on watching James Gunn’s revitalised Superman, freshly rendered, as it is, in the sort of bright hues that have proven anathema to the character since 2013. As other turns attest, Cavill has charisma and charm aplenty but sprawled terribly across a decade of moribund self-indulgence. His last turn, a bum note cameo in Dwayne Johnson puff project Black Adam, was meant to herald production on a long-gestated Man of Steel sequel. Alas, it was but ill conceived clickbait and soon followed by Cavill’s unceremonious shelving. His replacement is the younger, less seasoned but more baby-faced David Corenswet. On this debut alone, we might hope for a more dignified run. Gunn’s Superman is quite notably flawed but at least knows its raison d’etre: to entertain.
The film’s style is familiar. It’s Gunn’s penchant for pulp that powers proceedings, guiding a narrative set snugly at the intersection of crowd pleasing populism and omnipotent geekery. On the former count is broad humour, a cute super-powered dog and mewling alien baby. In the latter lies a half dozen unexpected cameos, winning callbacks to John Williams and Hans Zimmer in a stirring score from Johnny Murphy and David Fleming, and nerdy nods to fan favourite comics and bygone in-jokes. Devotees are hard to please and this review offers no insight as to how Gunn’s Superman will go down with the best versed of fans. As for the masses, likability contends with ensemble overcrowding and a certain aimlessness to the whole. Those less invested in the eight decade long antagony linking Superman with Lex Luther might well find the latter’s motivations somewhat petty</p>

<h2>Jurassic World: Rebirth</h2>
<p>The ingredients for a dynamite entry into the Jurassic Park canon are no great secret. They’ve been in the public domain since 1993, after all. Quite why it’s taken thirty years and six attempts to remix them into a genuinely thrilling, and legitimately original is less clear. To be clear, 2015’s Jurassic World was good fun but a legacy remake if ever one were. No matter. Not content with gifting LucasFilm the best Star Wars film of the twenty-first century, Gareth Edwards has done it again for the Steven Spielberg’s Franchisousaurus Rex. Putting a new tranche of stars through hell, Jurassic World: Rebirth is nothing short of a hoot.

Credit where due, Colin Trevorrow’s 2015–22 sequel trilogy, in which “Park” became “World,”must have been doing something right to keep the flame so well alight. Dominion was a dino-bore but still topped a billion at the post-Covid global box office. And yet, bar a retention of the   “World” moniker in its title, Rebirth bears far closer resemblance to Park era in scope and ambition. The notion that dinosaurs now rub shoulders with rush hour on the streets of New York, an inheritance of 2018’s Fallen Kingdom, remains a fun one but a return to the playpen of deadly jungle tropics is more fun still. In the thrash of leaves and rising mist, where your visibility is a pithy three metres ahead, anything could be – and absolutely is – hiding.</p>

<h2>Lilo & Stitch</h2>
<p>The furry blue foot remains very much within the box for Dean Fleischer Camp’s Lilo & Stitch, a live action replication of the Disney animated classic. 2002’s OG Hawaiian rollercoaster ride proved something of a rare bright spot in an era of woe for the House of Mouse. Amid a string of middling efforts in the noughties, only Chris Sanders and Dean DeBlois’ toon enjoyed both critical and commercial success. Extoling the virtues of family and second chances, Lilo & Stitch struck a multi-generational chord, tickling the old and young alike. 2025’s effort boasts a little less Elvis but a lot more of the same.

Can anybody blame them? Tweaks and reinventions of The Little Mermaid and Snow White hardly gifted Disney vast financial rewards, while it’s the old school Stitch merch that brings in the real big bucks. Besides, maybe familiar is what folks want. A cinematic tribute act. Sanders and DeBlois’ original film was breezy, smart, sentimental and funny. Guess what? So is Fleischer Camp’s new one. 

How could it not be? Ok, so perhaps there’s something to be said about the loss of the animation’s watercolour backgrounds and popping painterly colours in the transition to live-ish action. It’s not like the target audience will care – in this case, kids and 20-somethings. Not with Sanders back on elasticated vocal duties as the unruly, impulsive, and freakishly strong genetic experiment, Stitch. There’s no Sonic-level misfiring in this production, CGI Stitch is every bit the cuddly terror you want him to be and as tactile as they come. You’ll wish you could run your fingers through his shimmering fur.

The story remains that of three orphans, each overwhelmed and lost in their own internalised way. There’s Stitch himself, of course: unloved by his odorous, boggle-eyed creator, Zach Galifianakis’ Jumba Jookiba, exiled by the United Galactic Federation and escaped to Earth. Then, there’s Nani Pelekai (Sydney Elizebeth Agudong), a straight-A overachiever with clipped wings, the recent deaths of her parents compelling her to care for her much younger sister instead of pursuing a bright future at college. Native Hawaiian newcomer Maia Kealoha rounds off the trio as Lilo, the film’s beating heart and rebellious spirit. She’s an effervescent and instant delight.</p>
